U1 No, lets talk about lord of the rings
A1 Hypothetically speaking, if you were one of the female characters
from the Lord of The Rings or The Hobbit, which would you be?
U2 Wow I don’t know I guess Arwen is pretty cool.
A2 Awesome choice. For me personally? I would want to be Tauriel
more because she didn’t get tempted by the ring like Galadriel in the  rst one. Even though she was a purely movie character, her story seemed better to me. I remember the Galadriel scene where her face was a jump scare in the Lord of the Rings movie and that stayed with me for years! Did you want to me to ask you more middle earth based hypothetical questions?

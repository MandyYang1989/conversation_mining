U6 let’s talk about ourselves
A7 Would you rather face a TRex or a Brontosaurus in the Jurassic Park or Jurassic World movie?
U7 a brontosaurus
A8 For me personally? Brontosaurus are plant eaters so it would be interesting to see a lot more of those in the Jurassic World movie. I like carnivores however, seeing a tall animal would be exciting. Therefore, I would rather see a Brontosaurus in the Jurassic World movie. Do you want to hear another dinosaurs question?
U8   yes

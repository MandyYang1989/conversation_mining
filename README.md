# Conversation mining

## Conversation data

Publicly available datasets with conversation transcripts annotated with dialog acts:

* [Dialog State Tracking Challenge Series](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/dialog-state-tracking-challenge) provided several datasets with annotated information-seeking dialog transcripts for traveling and restaurant domains. Some of them are freely available. These datasets were created to evaluate and compare performance of dialog state trackers, systems able to interpret the user's action.  They also include ontologies describing the domain, which consists of attributes (slots) with a set of possible values for each of the attributes. The transcripts are annotated with the dialog acts, user goals, methods, attributes, time-stamps as well as the user feedback.
   
* [The Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus (SwDA)](https://github.com/cgpotts/swda) contains conversation transcripts of telephone conversations annotated with dialog acts, part-of-speech tags, lemmas and parse trees. 2400 phone conversations annotated with 42 types of dialog acts, 70 available topics (https://github.com/snakeztc/NeuralDialog-CVAE/blob/master/data/json_data/valid.jsonl)
    

* [Spoken Conversational Search Data Set](https://github.com/JTrippas/Spoken-Conversational-Search) provides conversational transcripts collected for three search tasks performed in a conversational speech-only setting. The transcripts are annotated with the timestamps, the corresponding search queries and dialog acts for each of the roles.
    

* [Open Data Exploration dataset](https://github.com/vendi12/ODExploration_data) for the conversational browsing task contains 26 transcripts annotated with dialog acts and entity spans.
